        "a": "Of course! The Figicons CLI & package will be free and open source forever."

    {
        "q": "Can I import my own icons?",
        "a": "Yep! Apart from the default icons, you can add your own ones that you've designed in Figma. Check the 'Custom Icons' section to learn more."
    },
    {
        "q": "Is only Figma supported?",
        "a": "For now at least. Currently Figicons only support a direct integration with Figma due to the ease of their API platform."
    },
    {
        "q": "What's this Designer Pack?",
        "a": "The Designer Pack is a downloadable folder containing all the default icons in SVG format. The aim of it is just for designers to be able to use the out-of-the-box icons in their designs."
    },
    {
        "q": "Are only stroked icons supported?",
        "a": "Yes. Figicons cleans all stroke properties from imported icons and adds a unified style over them, which you can later override."
    },
    {
        "q": "Does Figicons store my data?",
        "a": "Nope! Your icons are safe with you when you build them on your machine, nothing gets sent to us. We don't even have servers."
    },
    {
        "q": "Is there an online service?",
        "a": "Not yet, however there are plans to support a platform with team functionality to automate importing custom icons from Figma to direct usage in code."
