        "q": "Can I import my own icons?",
        "a": "Yep! Apart from the default icons, you can add your own ones that you've designed in Figma. Check the 'Custom Icons' section to learn more."

        "q": "Is only Figma supported?",
        "a": "Currently Figicons only support a direct integration with Figma due to the ease of their API platform. There are no plans as of yet to support other design tools."

        "q": "What's a Designer Pack?",
        "a": "The Designer Pack is a downloadable folder containing all the default icons in SVG format. The aim of it is for designers to be able to use the out-of-the-box icons within their designs."

        "q": "Are only lined icons supported?",
        "a": "Yes. Figicons optimizes & cleans all stroke properties from imported icons and adds a unified style over them, which you can override using the config from the API."
    },
    {
        "q": "Does Figicons store any of my data?",
        "a": "Nope! Your icons are safe with you when you build them on your machine, nothing gets sent to us. We don't even have servers."
    },
    {
        "q": "Is there an online service?",
        "a": "Not yet, however there are plans to support a web platform with team functionality to automate importing custom icons from Figma and converting them directly to React components."
