        "q": "Is only Figma supported?",
        "a": "For now at least. Currently Figicons only support a direct integration with Figma due to the ease of their API platform. However, you can still manually add your SVG icon exports in and convert them using Figicons."

    {
        "q": "Are only stroked icons supported?",
        "a": "Yes. Figicons cleans all stroke properties from imported icons and adds a unified style over them, which you can later override."
